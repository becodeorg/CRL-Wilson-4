## Requirements

This briefing assumes that you know how to:

* consult the manual within the terminal


## The mission

You've heard of a bunch of new commands to work with files `cat`, `touch`,
`mkdir`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm` and `rmdir`. Open your *terminal* and *read their
manuals* to understand them, then follow the instructions below.

### Instructions
1. create a file named `one.txt`
2. type `echo "Hello World" > one.txt`
3. print the content of that file on the screen
4. create a folder named `story`
5. move `one.txt` into that folder
6. copy `one.txt` inside the folder `story` as `two.txt`
7. print the content of both files
8. rename `one.txt` to `part_one.txt` and `two.txt` to `part_two.txt`
9. type `echo "I am a junior at BeCode." > story/part_two.txt`
10. print the content of both files simultaneously
11. remove the folder `story` and all its content

There is two way to remove a folder, try to find both.


## Congrats

You are now able to manage all your files and folders in the command line.
Although it might not be obvious, *the terminal is a very powerful and modern
environment* which will save you lots of time if you're willing to learn how to
use it.
