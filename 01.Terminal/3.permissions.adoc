== Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should be able to:

* execute a command as root
* check the permissions of a file
* change the permissions of a file
* change the owner of a file
* change the group of a file

== Requirements

This briefing assumes that you know how to:

* consult the manual within the terminal
* create and read files in the terminal
* list a directory contents

== The mission

You've heard of four new tools to manage {permissions}[permissions] and execute
commands with administrative rights `sudo`, `chmod`, `chown` and `chgrp`. Open
your *terminal* and *read their manuals* to understand them, then follow the
instructions below.

.Instructions

* create a file
* check the owner and group of the file (use `ls`)
* change its owner to *root*
* change its group to *root*
* check that file's permission (use `ls`)
* give all rights to owner and group, but none to others
* try to print the file on screen
* print the file with root privileges

== Congrats

Permissions and ownership can be tough to grasp but they allow for multiple
people to work on the same system with all their data secured.
