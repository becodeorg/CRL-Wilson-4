## Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should be able to:

* execute a command as root
* check the permissions of a file
* change the permissions of a file
* change the owner of a file
* change the group of a file

## Requirements

This briefing assumes that you know how to:

* consult the manual within the terminal
* create and read files in the terminal
* list a directory contents

## The mission

You've heard of four new tools to manage {permissions}[permissions] and execute
commands with administrative rights `sudo`, `chmod`, `chown` and `chgrp`. Open
your *terminal* and *read their manuals* to understand them, then follow the
instructions below.

### Instructions

1. create a file
2. check the owner and group of the file (use `ls`)
3. change its owner to *root*
4. change its group to *root*
5. check that file's permission (use `ls`)
6. give all rights to owner and group, but none to others
7. try to print the file on screen
8. print the file with root privileges

## Congrats

Permissions and ownership can be tough to grasp but they allow for multiple
people to work on the same system with all their data secured.
