## Mission objectives

You have been asked by several sports club to create a platform so that team member could share message with their team, and their team only! Your platform would allow coaches from a team to create a message lobby. Once their lobby is created coaches (admin) can add users to their team so they can access the lobby.

All information has to be stored in a PostgreSQL or Mysql(MariaDB) database.

All the below features have to be implemented in the form of a REST API, this API should only return JSON not HTML!

Please it's time to use EcmaScript modules.
Want an extra challenge ? Implement the MVC structure

### ðŸŒ± Must have features

-   User can create a message lobby (and become the admin of said lobby)
-   Users can view message from their lobby
-   Users can post message on their lobby
-   Users can edit their own message

### ðŸŒ¼ Nice to have features (doable)

-   Admin can delete message in their lobby

### ðŸŒ³ Nice to haves (hard)

-   Users can join multiple teams

-   Admins can add people that have not yet registered to the platform.
